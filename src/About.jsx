                <p>
                Hello! Iâ€™m a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo and an aspiring software engineer! I am also the social media coordinator at <a href="https://kurius.ca">Kurius</a>, an organization dedicated to empowering students to create social good through technology! I am currently looking for a <b>Spring 2022 internship</b>!
                </p>
                <p> My goal is to build software that are useful, whether it be in the biomedical, finance or game development field. I love getting my hands on all the aspects of software development: design, front-end, backend!
                </p>
                <p>
                In my free time, I like to code (yes!) on personal projects or hackathons. I also like to draw and play badminton and am a gym enthusiast!
                </p>
